		"text": "Cavan comes from the old Irish word for ‘hollow’ or ‘little hill’, and all a takes is a few minutes driving in the countryside to understand how the name was attached to this place. It’s a land of drumlins, small-scale hills and ridges that alternate with a spectacular network of wooded lakes. This is ideal country for walking, angling or simply enjoying the outdoors. In the ancient days of Gaelic Ireland, Cavan was part of the Bréifne kingdom, and it remained under the jurisdiction of the O’Reilly clan. This was long before anything resembling the modern-day town was in place. The O’Reillys built a castle in the 1200s, along with St Mary’s Abbey. The bell tower of the Abbey remains an iconic fixture of Cavan to this day, though the rest of the structure was lost. However, the stones of the friary were used to build many historic buildings that are still standing in Cavan. The O’Reilly clan maintained its grip on Cavan until the 1400s, when the Nine Years War saw English troops battling Irish clans for control of the countryside. The clans lost control of the region, and the English brought in Protestant settlers from Scotland to wrest power from those loyal to the Catholic church. This led to further uprisings and rebellions that would continue for centuries through to the War for Irish Independence. Today, Cavan is a hidden gem that many visitors are completely unaware of. Less than a 90 minute drive from Dublin, Cavan is an ideal weekend destination. That said, many visitors leave wishing they had scheduled more time in Ireland’s Lake Lands – especially during the summer months."

		"text": "County Monaghan takes its name from the Irish ‘Muineacháin’, meaning ‘little hills’. Inhabited from an early era, many relics of the Bronze Age have been unearthed throughout the county over the years. It was later the centre and heartland of the kingdom of Oriel, and an ancient monument at Donaghmoyne is reputed to have been the residence of the Kings of Oriel. The arrival of Christianity saw St. Patrick visit several locations in the county, while his ‘right-hand man’ – St. Macartan became patron of the diocese of which County Monaghan forms approximately one half.  Tiernach of Clones and Dympna of Tydavnet later became two of Ireland’s best known saints. The Vikings were invaders during the 10-11th centuries and a Viking fort is still visible near Glaslough, while a later Norman motte and bailey stands at Donaghmoyne.  Prior to the 17th century Plantation's County Monaghan was ruled by the McMahons who controlled four fifths of its area, and the McKennas who controlled the remaining one fifth. When the Elizabethans decided in 1585 to divide Ulster into ‘shire-land’, the boundaries of the county were laid out, roughly the same as todays, but it was not until the first decade of the 17th century that the county was officially formed and named. From the 15th to 17th centuries the McMahons and the McKennas formed part of the armies of the O’Neills and were a constant thorn in the side of the English, whose territory ‘The Pale’, just touched the southern end of the present county. In the Nine Years War (1595-1603) the first major battle was fought at Clontibret while the McMahon/McKenna combination also figured in later battles and in the defeat at Kinsale in 1601. Mountjoy’s forces pursued them following that defeat and destroyed many of their fortifications. Elections were always keenly contested in the county, none more so than in 1826 when, on the instigation of Daniel O’Connell, Westenra was elected by the Catholic voters as a pro-Emancipation candidate and again in 1833 when Parnell addressed huge meetings at Castleblayney, Monaghan, Emyvale and Scotstown in support of Tim Healy, who then became the first ever nationalist MP for the county. The Monaghan of today is a county with strong links to its historical past and many towns and villages retain and portray a history and tradition of times long past. There are heritage trails in Monaghan, Clones and Carrickmacross and many sites of historical interest including Edergole Court Tomb, Mannan Castle Motte and Bailey, Inniskeen Round Tower and Lisnadarragh Wedge Tomb."

		"text": "Situated half way between the two biggest cities in Ireland, Belfast and Dublin, lies the smallest county in Ireland, Louth. The 'Wee County' as it is affectionately known to the Irish is beautifully situated on the North East coats of the island with its long, beautiful beaches stretching away from the towering Mountains of Mourne to the North. Carlingford Lough is one of Ireland's most famous lakes with breathtaking scenery stretching even to the Isle of Man across the Irish Sea. The rugged mountains that tower over the town provide splendid country for hill walking and cater to those in search of the perfect view. Nearby, situated along the Lough is the Tain Holiday Village a 10-acre site with all sorts of water and adventure activities for the whole family and a wide choice of accommodation. From Carlingford one can strike out along the 40 km Tain Way bringing the visitor though the wild and romantic Cooley Peninsula. But if shopping or something more relaxing is what you're after Louth's two biggest towns, Drogheda and Dundalk can see to your needs. One of Ireland's oldest ands most historical towns Drogheda traces its history back to 1194. Drogheda is associated with an extraordinary number of significant events in the history of Ireland - The Battle of the Boyne, St Oliver Plunkett, Poynings Law, Cromwell's Siege and the surrender of the Irish Chieftains to the English King. These days though the town is far more relaxed and the pleasant streets of Drogheda are home to many fine bars and restaurants. Ardee and Dundalk provide alternative bases from which to explore the county but whichever one a guest choose he or she can be assured of a warm reception. Louth's unique situation between the two biggest cities in Ireland has bred a tradition of hospitality into the very ground. The war and friendly atmosphere will be unmistakable wherever you go in the county. With its mix of the modern and the mythic, the urban and the unusual Louth becomes more and more attractive to visitors with each passing year. Convenient to the big cities and with accommodation to suit every budget a visit is highly recommended."

		"text": "The Irish name of County Meath is Contae na Mhí, the literal (and rather unexciting) meaning being 'The Middle'. Together with County Westmeath, County Meath once formed the 'Fifth Province of Ireland, the one politically in the middle of things. Cars registered in County Meath will have the letters MH on their number plates. The county town is Navan, other important towns include Ashbourne, Dunboyne, Dunshaughlin, Kells, Oldcastle, and Trim. Especially those towns near to the Dublin border have grown immensely during the boom years, housing commuters more than anything else. Meath has a size of 2,338 square kilometers. According to the 2011 census, 184,135 people live here - since 1991, the population of County Meath grew by 75%, this is the highest population growth in Ireland and mainly due to Dublin 'expanding'. The most common county nickname is 'Royal Meath', after the former seat of the Irish High Kings on the Hill of Tara. With the 1690 battle site Boyne river, Meath has the most important 'pilgrimage site' for Unionists. Meath is not only the 'Royal County', but chock-a-block with historic and majestic sites. Pride of place must, however, go to Bru na Bóinne, which provides a very informative visitor center and a gateway to the passage tombs of Newgrange and Knowth. Access to both is by guided tour only and all start at the visitor center (which is well sign-posted, but actually on the other side of the river). The reconstruction of the mound at Newgrange might be debatable, but impressive it is. If you want to get away from the (in summer often) maddening crowd, make your own way to Dowth - the third major mound of the Bru na Bóinne complex, freely accessible, not restored and often left in solitary peace. Maybe second in fame only to Newgrange, the Hill of Tara is more a general feeling of antiquity than a tangible sight. When you come here, you'll see something akin to a not-very-well-kept golf course or rough-ish landscape park. Only with a guidebook and some imagination will you be able to explore the hidden wonders of this sprawling complex. The audio- visual show in the visitor center helps a lot, walking the Hill of Tara with an open mind and a bit of time will (maybe) open up its mysteries to you. Those tourists jumping from the bus, checking off their list and having a quick gander will not get the most from this site. Personally, we recommend cold, crisp winter mornings around sunrise - if you can live with the sheep droppings. Tayto Park is a 'theme park' in County Meath and geared at families with children, though the selection of animals on view makes it interesting for adults too. It is very good for a day out with the family, quite good if you visit without kids and are not on the lookout for peace and quiet. The focus is on physical activity and a learning experience, a very welcome change from passive entertainment. This is a top destination if you need to keep the kids amused in the greater Dublin area and the weather is with you."

		"text": "County Westmeath is sometimes referred to as “The Lake County” due to the abundance of lakes, streams and other waterways in the county. This inland county is part of the midlands and is in the province of Leinster. County Westmeath has a long and colourful history that predates its official charter. It is said that this was the meeting place of the five ancient provinces of Ireland. Prior to the arrival of St. Patrick, the county was the gathering place for the High Kings of Ireland. The Normans arrived about 1170 and built many castles and forts. The county was officially established in 1543 and was named after the historic kingdom of Mide. The county was centrally involved in the 1641 rebellion and was active in the Williamite wars. Most of the Irish or Norman landholders lost their land following the 1641 rebellion. Throughout the county you will find remarkable evidence of the region’s long and colourful past. Uisneagh Hill is an impressive hill nearly 180 meters tall. It is here that King Tuathal Teachmar erected his palace in the early second century. For two hundred years the pagan kings of Ireland ruled. There are many castles located within the county. Perhaps the most famous is Tullynally. This castle, which is still lived in by the family of the Earl of Longford, is a beautiful castle that is nearly a quarter of a mile long. One of the oldest Castles in Westmeath is Delvin Castle, built in 1181 by Hugh De Lacy. Athlone Castle was built in 1210 for King John of England. It was strategically placed to guard one of the main crossings of the River Shannon. Crookedwood Fort is one of the oldest structures in the county. It is related to the old Stories of Fionn, the mythological hunter and warrior or the Druids. Nearby at Taughmon is a fourteenth century fortified stone church. Many of the towns located within the county have their own distinct histories. The town of Fore is a medieval town containing a large moat from Anglo-Norman times. There are remnants of the ancient city walls and a Benedictine Monastery that was in use until Henry VIII closed it in 1539. The monastery contains superior ancient artwork and crosses. The population of Westmeath in 1841 was 141,300. During the Great Famine of 1845-1847, the population decreased until it was 111,407 in 1851. The population continued to decrease to 56,818 in 1926. In 2011, the population was 86,164."

Donegal is situated in the north-west of Ireland and is surrounded by 5 counties including Sligo, Leitrim, Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh making it a perfect platform to explore some hidden beauties. The County has six hundred and fifty kilometres of rugged coastline and sandy beaches to explore. Tory Island off of Donegal has a King. This is a unique tradition that does not exist anywhere else in Ireland. The current Rí Thoraí (Irish for King of Tory) is painter Patsaí Dan Mac Ruaidhrí (Patsy Dan Rodgers in English). The king has no formal powers; though duties include being a spokesperson for the island community and welcoming people to the island. The total population of the Island is under 200. Donegal has the second-largest Gaeltacht(where Irish is the first language) area in the whole of Ireland. Some famous people that have hailed from Donegal include the world famour singer Enya, the renowned trad group Clannad, country and western crooner Daniel O Donnnell, rock legend Rory Gallagher and for those of literary interest the poet William Allingham. All in all Donegal is a great place to visit while on holidays in Ireland."

		"text": "In ancient times Leitrim formed the western half of the Kingdom of Breifne, which from 1256 onwards was ruled over by the O’Rourke family. The O’Rourke’s heraldic symbol of the lion still has a presence in Leitrim’s official crest. Normans invaded in the 13th century and occupied the southern portion of the kingdom, though the O’Rourkes more or less maintained control through the 16th century, when modern day Leitrim was carved out of the ancient Kingdom of Breifne. The county suffered a number of rough blows in the mid-1800s. First, there was a recession caused by the mechanization of linen weaving (one of the county’s prime exports) in the 1830's. Then the Great Famine saw Leitrim's population of 155,000 (as of the 1841 census) plummet to 112,000 by 1851. In addition to the linen industry, Leitrim was also noted for its coal mining and mining of iron ore. The county’s last coal mine remained open until 1990 and now functions as a visitor center, the Arigna Mining Experience. Key attractions: Though Leitrim is the smallest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population (and the least populous of Ireland’s 32 counties), it should not be underestimated. Leitrim has many wonderful attractions and sights to behold. Leitrim has a dramatic hilly and mountainous landscape in its northwest and is relatively flat in the southeast. Lough Allen divides the middle of the county. It is an unspoiled, tranquil area of great natural beauty, consisting of lofty mountains, deep valleys, pastures, lakes, rolling hills and rivers. The extreme northwest Leitrim has a short Atlantic coastline (3 mi) between Sligo and Donegal. Carrick-on-Shannon, Leitrim’s county town, offers stunning views of the Shannon, fun nightlife and culture, and plenty of history with the Carrick Castle, Hatley Manor, and a workhouse and famine graveyard. The Carrick-on-Shannon Rowing Club has been in existence since 1827. Each August the town plays host to the annual August Holiday regatta. In addition to the Arigna Mining Experience, visitors may also learn about Leitrim’s industrial history at the Sliabh na Iarainn Visitor Center, which offers exhibitions and interactive learning experiences about the trade activity between the two mountain regions. The 50-feet-high Glencar Waterfall in Glencar Lough was a source of inspiration to William Butler Yeats. The surrounding area offers many peaceful and scenic walks and picnic spots. Glencar Waterfall in Glencar Lough was a source of inspiration to William Butler Yeats."
